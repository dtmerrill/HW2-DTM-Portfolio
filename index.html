		<h1>The Mind of Dana Merrill...</h1>

		<h3>A Frankensteinian approach to development and project/program management.</h3>
		<div>
			<p> 
				An artist using the best tools and materials can make magic. Often, however, only faulty tools are at hand and all the materials must be scrounged. Original thoughts of 'perfection' fly away and the need for something that works becomes the only goal. Dana has found himself in the lab many times after visits to the graveyard driving toward life in his code, project and program experiments and found it. Thankfully, not once has his creation destroyed him.

					</h3> 
					
					<p>
						Tabletop Auction House provides a marketplace for gamers and game masters to create and exchange in-game equipment, both reducing the creative pressure on the gm and establishing a unique channel by which games might grow and evolve. Sometimes you don’t want to have to think about the ‘simple’ things when it comes to world-building. Our marketplace takes some of that pressure off while also creating a way to advance the story to whatever depth is desired by the team.

						Based on a need to streamline and simplify our lives while at the same time increasing the complexity of our digital footprint, steps must be taken (get it, 'footprint'/'steps'?) to make access to that complexity both challenging to others to figure out and easy for us to apply.
